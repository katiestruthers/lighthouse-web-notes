# Reference: Big O

#### From smallest to largest...

| Big O    | Name        | If n doubles, runtime... | Example       |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| O(1)     | Constant    | is unaffected            | Directly access an element in array (i.e. array[5]) |
| O(logn)  | Logarithmic | increases by 1           | Binary search |
| O(n)     | Linear      | increases by n           | Linear search |
| O(n^2)   | Quadratic   | increases by n^2         | Nested loop |
