# Breakout Session: Technical Interviews, Part 2

### Three Major Types
1. White board &rarr; no VSCode, no auto-completes, etc. This can be in-person, or a virtual whiteboard experience via something like Google Docs.
2. Take-home challenge &rarr; a mini-project that will have a particular time constraint.
3. Pair programming &rarr; you and a developer from the company code through a problem together.

### Practice Your "Personal Pitch"
Some areas to focus on:
  * Your background &rarr; what did you do before starting your web development career?
  * Your relevant experience &rarr; includes education (Lighthouse Labs!), projects, etc.
  * Your passion &rarr; what do you love about web development?

* Combining your background, your experience, and your passion, THIS will be what you will be uniquely bringing to the company!

### When Working Through a TI Problem...
1. (Ask) Establish understanding of what they are asking for. Ask LOTS of questions! Some examples:
  * How we are capturing input? (passed into a function, CLI, web form, etc.)
  * What should the output look like? (console logged, saved to a file, etc.)
  * Should input / output be a specific data-type?
  * Should I consider edge cases - user inputted wrong data-type, error-handling, etc.

2. (Establish Approach) Pseudocode! Go through the steps it would take to solve the problem.
  * If you don't know: admit it. BUT don't leave it at that! Explain how you would find the answer you are looking for.

3. (Writing the Code) Repitition and practice is key here, as you won't have the luxury of an IDE!
  * If there are methods / language features you don't wuite remember, put your best guess and explain you know how to check the docs

4. (Test the Code) Rubber ducky method! Walk through how the function SHOULD run.
  * Use an example input value and the expected output value

### Example
You are building a Node.js application for an online store. The store sells products, and you need to implement a feature that calculates the total revenue generated by the store. You are given an array of objects, where each object represents a product sold. Each product object has the following properties:
* name (string): the name of the product
* price (number): the price of the product
* quantity (number): the quantity sold

Your task is to write a function called calculateTotalRevenue(products) that takes in the array of product objects and returns the total revenue generated by the store.
* INPUTS: Array of Product Objects
* OUTPUTS: Number (Total Revenue)

```js
const exampleSoldProducts = [
  {name: 'Keyboad', price: 20.00, quantity: 2},
  {name: 'Mouse', price: 15.00, quantity: 1},
  {name: 'Coffe Mug', price: 4.50, quantity: 8}
];

/**
 * Calculates total revenue based on an array of sold products
 * 
 * @param {Array} arrayOfProducts
 * @returns {Number} Total revenue of all sold products
 */
const calculateTotalRevenue = function(arrayOfProducts) {
  let totalRevenue = 0;

  // Loop through the products
  for (const product of arrayOfProducts) {
    // Get total of the product's sales
    let productSales = product.price * product.quantity;

    // Add the product sales to the total revenue
    totalRevenue += productSales;
  }

  return totalRevenue;
};

const result = calculateTotalRevenue(exampleSoldProducts);
console.log('Result:', result); // Result: 91
```
