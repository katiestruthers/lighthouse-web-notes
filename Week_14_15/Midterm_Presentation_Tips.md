# Midterm Presentation Tips

### What NOT To Do
* Have low energy - you've built an app! Show your excitement for what you've created.
* Have bad lighting or a camera angle that doesn't clearly show your whole face
* Being confused about respective role of navigator vs. presentor
* Not adequately practicing!
* Even if you made a login page, you do not need to show it and waste a minute of your five minute presentation logging in

### What TO Do
* Use a narrative - how should a new user should walk through the app for the first time?
* Spend as much time in the app as possible! Even if you aren't directly interacting with it, have it open while you are talking
* Talk about why you made certain UI decisions and how you wanted the user to experience your app
* If you had more time, what additional features would you add?
* What are the most important lessons you learned? i.e. working in a Git workflow, etc.
