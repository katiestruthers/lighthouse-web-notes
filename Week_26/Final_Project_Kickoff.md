# Final Project Kickoff

### Five Rules of Success @ LHL
1. Ask for help!
2. Put in the hours.
3. Take breaks & get proper sleep.
4. Don't compare yourself to others.
5. Be comfortable being uncomfortable.

* Just like in midterms, focus on your MINIMUM VIABLE DEMO.
  * If it won't be in the presentation, don't bother building it!

### Don't Start With Code!
* Idea &rarr; 
* User Stories &rarr; 
* Resources &rarr; 
* ERD &rarr; 
* Routes &rarr;
* Wireframes

* Create a planning directory in your GitHub repo!

### Tips for Project Success
* Leave only polish, cleanup, and demo prep for W30
* Learning new frameworks and languages means less features
* Prioritize risk mitigation upfront
* Communicate regularly
* Estimation is hard, but very important
  * The more you break things down, the easier it will be to estimate!

### Schedule
* Week 27: Start + Plan
* Week 28: Code
* Week 29: Code
* Week 30: Demo 

### Tips for Personal Success
It's possible to have a successful project, but unsuccessful personal goals!
* Write down your technical + non-technical weaknesses, and share them
* Don't just stick to what you know; get full-stack exposure
* You should be able to speak to the *entire* codebase
  * If you don't know what code is doing, get your teammate who wrote it to explain it to you.

### What's the Ideal Final Look Like?
* Well-designed (looks polished)
* Uses modern framework(s) like Rails, Reacts, etc.
* Uses moderns CSS & co. (FlexBox, CSS Grid, SASS, etc.)

### Common Code Quality Issues
i.e. things to address in your Final Project after graduation:
* Some stuff is faked out, like the login page &rarr; can turn an MVD into an MVP?
* It's often "hackathon" quality code (rushed and not your best work)
* Little to no automated testing
  * If you have some extra time in Week 30, add in some Cypress testing! It can also possibly be incorporated into your presentation.

### Alternative / New Ideas
i.e. approach with caution...
* Using a language that you have not yet learned (e.g. TypeScript)
* Contributing to an existing FOSS project
  * While something you should definitely consider pursuing post-bootcamp, it may be too much for finals
* Building a solution for a real organization
  * Now you have a real stakeholder! There will be some give-or-take, and they are expecting you to deliver, not just build a MVD and abandon it after demo day
* Involve hardware (Pi, Robots, etc.)

### What's a Good Demo Look Like?
* Presenters don't look miserable &rarr; instead, they at least *act* like they are having fun. Have a positive attitude!
* No major bugs (avoid / hide them if they exist)
* Flows well, and is well-rehearsed
* Teams show off their skills, not just the project

### Most Common Team Challenges
* Starting slow (taking it easy) and then crunch mode / panic at the end
* Team Communication
* Git Collaboration (not keeping branches up to date)
* Database Changes
