# Breakout Session: Technical Interviews

TIP: Let go of the outcome, and instead simply aim to learn one new thing every time you practice interviewing.

### Researching the Employer
* What sort of apps do they work on? What tech stack do they use? What is the overall brand identity and larger goals of the company?
* Consider what you can bring to the role you are applying to.

### Advocate for Yourself
Make sure to have the answers prepared for the following questions:
  1. What are your skills?
  2. Have you attended related schooling; if so, where and what did you study?
  3. What sort of work experience do you have?
  4. What do you do in your downtime?
  5. What are you passionate about?
  6. Have you had success in a team environment?
  7. What sort of programs and languages are you familiar with?

### Common Formats for Behavioural Questions
* How would you approach a problem where...?
* Can you recall a time that you exhibited X quality?
* What sort of experience do you have with X tool / technology?
* If you experience an error X, how would you troubleshoot it?

### General Tips
* Talk out loud, especially when you're reading code
  * Try to figure out what the code is trying to do and communicate that with the interviewer
* Always ask clarifying questions, or in the very least, repeat the questions back to the interviewer
  * Also think about edge cases!
* Feel free to take notes if there are a lot of specific details to remember
* You can ask for sample input / output or come up with your own if none provided
* Clearly state your approach out loud
* Start writing code if you feel confident or write pseudocode if you need more time to think
* Walk through your code with sample input / output once you finish
